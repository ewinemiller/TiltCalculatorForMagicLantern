Tilt Calculator
===============

Tilt-shift lenses give amazing control of the depth of field by rotating the focus plane, but without knowing how much tilt to dial in, focusing can be frustrating and time consuming.
Tilt Calculator finds the tilt given your focal length and distance to the hinge point. No more trial and error focusing with your tilt-shift. Focus where you want it.
